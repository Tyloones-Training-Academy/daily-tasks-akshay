# Daily Tasks - Akshay

Here are some key guidelines to follow when writing clean and well-documented code for your daily tasks:
 
## Meaningful Naming
 
1. Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and branches.
2. Avoid abbreviations unless they are widely understood within the team.
3. Strive for names that clearly explain the purpose of the code element.

## Code Readability
 
### Formatting
1. Use consistent indentation and spacing to improve visual clarity.
2. Adhere to a common coding style guide if your company has one.

## Comments
1. Add comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious sections of code.
2. Focus on explaining "why" something is done, not just "what" the code does.

## Function Size

1. Keep functions focused on a single, well-defined task.
2. Break down large functions into smaller, more manageable ones.

## DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself):
 
1. Avoid duplicating code blocks.
2. If you find yourself writing similar logic multiple times, consider creating reusable functions or classes.

## Testing:
 
1. Write unit tests to verify the correctness of your code.
2. This helps catch bugs early and ensures your code functions as expected.
